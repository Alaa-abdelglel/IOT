          What we have seen so far is just the beginning of IoT. It is an ever
          growing technology which will show its impact in a decade. Internet of
          Things can be used for a wide range of industries as it brings
          customer satisfaction into consideration, which is an ultimate goal
          for every business. It is a technology which will undoubtedly make the
          world a better place to live in. Also, there is a need to encrypt the
          data and to protect it as there are billions of devices connected via
          IoT. The chances of breaching its security are continually increasing,
          which is an area of concern and should be taken care of.
