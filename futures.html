        <div class="contentText">
          <p>Here are 10 predictions about the future of IoT.<br /></p>

          <h2>
            1. By 2025, it is estimated that there will be more than to 21
            billion IoT devices
          </h2>

          <p>
            A quick look back shows where IoT devices are going. Consider: In
            2016, there were more than 4.7 billion things connected to the
            internet, according to IOT Analytics. Fast-forward to 2021? The
            market will increase to nearly 11.6 billion IoT devices.
          </p>

          <h2>
            2. Cybercriminals will continue to use IoT devices to facilitate
            DDoS attacks
          </h2>

          <p>
            In 2016, the world was introduced to the first “Internet of Things”
            malware — a strain of malicious software that can infect connected
            devices such as DVRs, security cameras, and more. The Mirai malware
            accessed the devices using default password and usernames.
          </p>

          <p>
            What happened next? The malware turned the affected devices into a
            botnet to facilitate a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack,
            which aims to overwhelm websites with internet traffic. The attack
            ended up flooding one of the largest website hosting companies in
            the world, bringing a variety of major, well-known websites and
            services to a halt for hours.
          </p>

          <p>
            This particular strain of malware is called “open source,” which
            means the code is available for anyone to modify.
          </p>

          <h2>3. More cities will become “smart”</h2>

          <p>
            Consumers won’t be the only ones using IoT devices. Cities and
            companies will increasingly adopt smart technologies to save time
            and money.
          </p>

          <p>
            That means cities will be able to automate, remotely manage, and
            collect data through things like visitor kiosks, video camera
            surveillance systems, bike rental stations, and taxis.
          </p>

          <h2>
            4. Artificial intelligence will continue to become a bigger thing
          </h2>

          <p>
            Smart home hubs, thermostats, lighting systems, and even coffee
            makers collect data on your habits and patterns of usage. When you
            set up voice-controlled devices, you allow them to record what you
            say to them and store those recordings in the cloud. In most cases,
            the data is collected to help facilitate what is called machine
            learning.
          </p>

          <p>
            Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that helps
            computers “learn” without someone having to program them. The
            computers are programmed in a way that focuses on data that they
            receive. This new data can then help the machine “learn” what your
            preferences are and adjust itself accordingly. For instance, when a
            video website suggests a movie you might like, it’s likely learned
            your preferences based on your past choices.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Routers will continue to become more secure and smarter</h2>

          <p>
            Because most consumer IoT devices reside in the home and can’t have
            security software installed on them, they can be vulnerable to
            attacks. Why? A lot of manufacturers work to get their IoT products
            to market quickly, so security may be an afterthought. This is where
            the home router plays a very important role. The router is
            essentially the entry point of the internet into your home.
          </p>

          <p>
            While many of your connected devices cannot be protected, the router
            has the ability to provide protection at the entry point. A
            conventional router provides some security, such as password
            protection, firewalls, and the ability to configure them to only
            allow certain devices on your network.
          </p>

          <p>
            Router makers will likely continue to seek new ways to boost
            security.
          </p>

          <h2>6. 5G Networks will continue to fuel IoT growth</h2>

          <p>
            Major wireless carriers will continue to roll out 5G networks. 5G —
            fifth-generation cellular wireless — promises greater speed and the
            ability connect more smart devices at the same time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Faster networks mean the data accumulated by your smart devices will
            be gathered, analyzed and managed to a higher degree. That will fuel
            innovation at companies that make IoT devices and boost consumer
            demand for new products.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Cars will get even smarter</h2>

          <p>
            The arrival of 5G will shift the auto industry into a higher gear.
            The development of driverless cars — as well as the connected
            vehicles already on the road — will benefit from data moving faster.
          </p>

          <p>
            You might not think of your car as an Internet of Things device. But
            new cars will increasingly analyze your data and connect with other
            IoT devices — including other high-tech vehicles on four wheels.
          </p>

          <h2>
            8. 5G’s arrival will also open the door to new privacy and security
            concerns
          </h2>

          <p>
            In time, more 5G IoT devices will connect directly to the 5G network
            than via a Wi-Fi router. This trend will make those devices more
            vulnerable to direct attack.
          </p>

          <p>
            For home users, it will become more difficult to monitor all IoT
            devices, because they will bypass a central router.
          </p>

          <p>
            On a broader scale, the increased reliance on cloud-based storage
            will give attackers new targets to attempt to breach.
          </p>

          <h2>9. IoT-based DDoS attacks will take on more dangerous forms</h2>

          <p>
            Botnet-powered&nbsp;distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks
            have used infected IoT devices to&nbsp;bring down websites. IoT
            devices can be used to direct other attacks.<br />
          </p>

          <p>
            For instance, there may be future attempts to weaponize IoT devices.
            A possible example would be a nation shutting down home thermostats
            in an enemy state during a harsh winter.
          </p>

          <h2>
            10. Security and privacy concerns will drive legislation and
            regulatory activity
          </h2>

          <p>
            The increase in IoT devices is just one reason security and privacy
            concerns are rising.
          </p>

          <p>
            In mid-2018, the European Union implemented the General Data
            Protection Regulation. GDPR has led to similar security and privacy
            initiatives in several nations around the world. In the United
            States, California recently passed a tougher privacy law.
          </p>

            control over your data.
