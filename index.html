        <h1>What is the Internet of Things?</h1>
        <div class="contentText">
          The Internet of Things, or IoT, refers to the billions of physical
          devices around the world that are now connected to the internet, all
          collecting and sharing data. Thanks to the arrival of super-cheap
          computer chips and the ubiquity of wireless networks, it's possible to
          turn anything, from something as small as a pill to something as big
          as an aeroplane, into a part of the IoT. Connecting up all these
          different objects and adding sensors to them adds a level of digital
          intelligence to devices that would be otherwise dumb, enabling them to
          communicate real-time data without involving a human being. The
          Internet of Things is making the fabric of the world around us more
          smarter and more responsive, merging the digital and physical
          universes.
